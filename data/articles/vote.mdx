It’s your duty to start voting now! There are some very important issues at stake. You see, we NEED to know the answer to many, many, questions. Which is better, Canada or the USoA*, Sweden or Norway**, My feckless ex school co-atendees or the feckless ingrates that went to the other local plebeian educational establishment***.

The big question of course is how to decide the answer to such important things, how indeed?

We could get together a bunch of academics to do some in-depth analysis into the two groups and define some qualitative measures between the two to determine which would give the bet results in some given situations and thus see which would be better. I mean, it’s always going to be a judgement call, but you can make some broad sweeping statements maybe.

However, that’s all in the past now, for a, new, bold method has been created, yes the kind people of Facebook have inadvertently solved all future arguments, for ever. All you do, is crate two groups, invite people to join either of the groups and there you have it. PROOF that one thing is better than the other.

Either that, or you end up with a bunch of feckless wankers banding together for no good reason other than by virtue of where they grew up indulging in some kind of tedious text based egotistical masturbatory self aggrandisement group.

If I wanted to extol the virtues of my former school over another, I probably would not rely on how many moronic past attendees I could dupe into clicking a button on a stupid website.

*Canada
**Sweden
***The other one, results clearly show this, get over it.

You need to be angry about more things. Might I suggest the following:
1) Wanting to order 2 Chicken Kievs, but only ordering 1, and then having to wait an extra 30 minutes for them to cook the second.
2) While eating said Kiev, spilling garlic butter down your shirt.
3) Wasting 1000 pounds on a shirt
4) Poor parenting
5) Poor choice of friends in your formative years
6) European Employment Law

That is all.
