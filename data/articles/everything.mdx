“Ryan” from Glasgow who claims “Parents don’t influence responsible/irresponsible drinking in their children.

Fuckwhit.

You do not understand the economic crisis, if you did you would not be wasting time writing asinine comments on the internet portraying yourself as a economic genius.

Tracey ‘Mild Tallent at best’ Emin.
