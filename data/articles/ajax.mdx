Hello I’m Ajax, I like cleaning toilets, playing football and stabbing nasty Trojans, sometimes, just sometimes, I like to tinker about with web paged to do some fancy stuff with external data.

What I do not do is EVERYTHING that’s non static on the flaming web. So hey lets stop using abusing my good name for a simple bit of JavaScript that swaps an image, especially when you are claiming that a page “needs some AJAX” just cause you are too bloody useless to do your job properly.

If you don’t listen i’ll bloody well smite your nose off with my 7 ox-hide shield. That’ll learn you.
