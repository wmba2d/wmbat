If they cared so much about the fucking environment why have they spent the last 400 years making massive packets for no reason at all. I‚Äôll tell you why, it‚Äôs cause they hate the environment and they hate us, the customers, why else would they treat us like simpering imbeciles, one day dazzling us with BIGGER BETTER MORE the next with SMALLER SUPERER MORE for the same damn product.</p>
<p>God I hate the myself and the nation for pandering to these bloody ad campaigns, I‚Äôm so annoyed I‚Äôm off for a double skinny mocha chocha latte at Starbucks on my Vespa, now where did I put those Gucci shoes I wanted to wear, I need to look cool‚Ä¶ GAAAA</p>
