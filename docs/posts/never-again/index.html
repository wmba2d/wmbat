<p>Right, so you want rules to stop companies trading when they know they are about to go bust do you.</p>
<p>Fine so we’ll make a rule, just cause you asked nicely Michelle. Oh hang on what’s this, another company took an order from you 5 seconds before falling foul of this new rule.</p>

<p>Oh no wait, you’re just a blistering dunderhead who has no idea about anything so I think on this occasion we’ll just go ahead and ignore you if it’s all the same.
