<p>You need to be angry about more things. Might I suggest the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wanting to order 2 Chicken Kievs, but only ordering 1, and then having to wait an extra 30 minutes for them to cook the second.</li>
<li>While eating said Kiev, spilling garlic butter down your shirt.</li>
<li>Wasting 1000 pounds on a shirt</li>
<li>Poor parenting</li>
<li>Poor choice of friends in your formative years</li>
<li>European Employment Law</li>
</ol>
<p>That is all.</p></div></div><footer class="border-t-4 border-black mt-5 pt-5"><div><a href="/">WMBAT</a></div></footer></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"post":{"source":{"compiledSource":"/*@jsxRuntime automatic @jsxImportSource react*/\nconst {Fragment: _Fragment, jsx: _jsx, jsxs: _jsxs} = arguments[0];\nconst {useMDXComponents: _provideComponents} = arguments[0];\nfunction _createMdxContent(props) {\n  const _components = Object.assign({\n    p: \"p\",\n    ol: \"ol\",\n    li: \"li\"\n  }, _provideComponents(), props.components);\n  return _jsxs(_Fragment, {\n    children: [_jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"It’s your duty to start voting now!
