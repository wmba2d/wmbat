Nothing at all that’s what. Well nothing other than the rage inducing people of Ealing town that is. Not all of the people obviously, there are some who stay at home, some that just pass by and some who might just be normal enough not to cause a bout of apoplexy. However there is a breed apart from these people and alas they all do the same thing, they work in shops, as sales assistance, and they like to annoy the bejesus out of people who have the audacity to put so much as a toe inside their store.","rating":1,"slug":"help","readingTime":"4 min read"},{"title":"Key rage","publishedAt":"2008-09-19","excerpt":"This is the main source of my rage today, why doesit even exist, why?

Knowing this fact its quite a surprise that my upstairs neighbour seems totally unable to use the fucking things. Every single day I used to come home to find the front (1) door wide open to the world, I would proceed to front (2) door to find, yes you guessed it WIDE BLOODY OPEN. Now I confess that both had odd locks, one was a pain to shut and one you had to get out your key and explicitly lock it (no Yale lock here, oh no).","rating":4,"slug":"lock","readingTime":"3 min read"},{"title":"We can never let this happen again!","publishedAt":"2008-09-13","excerpt":"Only two days ago I was searching for trips to Egypt over New Year. XL came up on the search and I could have booked with them only yesterday. It is shocking that with this imminent collapse the company was still happy to take people’s money when they knew what was going to happen.There should be rules to prevent this sort of behaviour.","rating":1,"slug":"never-again","readingTime":"2 min read"},{"title":"Numbers numbers","publishedAt":"2008-09-11","excerpt":"What an interesting news day, a rage inducing news day. You might imagine that the downfall of the global markets might be a cause of spot anger.

Standing there arguing with the beleaguered driver won’t change this fact, claiming that you have £10 on your card holds little water in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. The fact that your retarded friends have paid and gone up the stairs whilst shouting after you to hurry up won’t change the fact that you have failed to gain admission to this wonderful transport mechanism.","rating":3,"slug":"oyster","readingTime":"3 min read"},{"title":"Salubrious West Ealing in bloom","publishedAt":"2008-09-12","excerpt":"Not only are there no busses (apart from the 83, more on that in a bit) this morning due to some strike or other, I have to witness the curious act of the council fixing brackets and hanging baskets of flowers from my local street lights… Now call me seasonally naïve but isn’t spring or summer not better the time to do this. Surely this catastrophic waste of money will result in pots of dead flowers in a few weeks and a sense that the whole place is a festering craphole (silence Andy) so bad that that they can’t be bothered to take away the springs now long dead flower baskets.
